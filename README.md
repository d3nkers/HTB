Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've compiled my notes from my Hack The Box (HTB) Academy modules. Dive in and explore the wealth of insights I've gathered along my journey through various challenges and modules.

Inside, you'll find a diverse array of notes—some meticulously detailed, others more concise, and a few containing nothing but the elusive answers. Hey, we all have those lazy moments, especially as we near the end of a module, right? But fear not, 
the essence of the steps to take is usually embedded within the modules themselves, sparing me the labor of transcribing every detail.

These notes are primarily for my personal reference, serving as a treasure trove of knowledge that I continually enrich with new discoveries. Stay tuned, as I plan to spice things up by adding write-ups and challenges I've conquered at HTB.

Remember, while you're welcome to peruse and benefit from this repository, bear in mind that quick progress doesn't always equate to true mastery. So, if you find yourself racing through modules without grasping the fundamentals—like navigating Nmap and deciphering its results—you might be cheating yourself in the long run. 
After all, true success lies in understanding the intricacies and nuances of the craft.
