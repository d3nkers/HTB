HTB BRIEF INTRO TO HARDWARE ATTACKS

This is a mini module where I also take extra notes to do research on later when I've finished the module.

Bluetooth Hacking
Bluetooth technology, designed for short-range wireless communication between devices, is ubiquitous in today's digital era. Despite its convenience, it opens up a new attack surface for hackers. In this section, we'll dive into several types of Bluetooth hacking:

Bluesnarfing: A cyber-attack involving unauthorised access to information from wireless devices through Bluetooth.
Bluejacking: An attack that sends unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices.
BlueSmacking: A Denial-of-Service attack that overwhelms a device's Bluetooth connection.
Bluebugging: A technique used to gain control over a device via Bluetooth.
BlueBorne: A set of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to take control of devices, spread malware, or perform other malicious activities via Bluetooth.
KNOB (Key Negotiation of Bluetooth): An attack that manipulates the data encryption process during Bluetooth connection establishment, weakening security.
BIAS (Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS): This attack exploits a vulnerability in the pairing process, allowing an attacker to impersonate a trusted device.

Several modern attacks, including BlueBorne, Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) Attack, and Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS (BIAS).

Bluetooth functionality is based on several key concepts, including device pairing, piconets, and data transfer protocols. The first step in establishing a Bluetooth connection is the pairing process. This involves two devices discovering each other and establishing a connection:

Discovery: One device makes itself discoverable, broadcasting its presence to other Bluetooth devices within range.
Pairing Request: A second device finds the discoverable device and sends a pairing request.
Authentication: The devices authenticate each other through a process involving a shared secret, known as a link key or long-term key. This may involve entering a PIN on one or both devices.


Understanding Microprocessors
Microprocessors, the (electronically) pulsating heart of our computers and digital devices, are not infallible. They can contain flaws or vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to perform unauthorised actions within a computer system. These vulnerabilities range from simple design flaws to complex security loopholes.

What is a Microprocessor
A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) that encapsulates the functions of a central processing unit (CPU) on a single silicon chip. A microprocessor is a type of CPU, but not all CPUs are microprocessors.


CVE-2017-5753
CVE-2017-5754
CVE-2017-5715

KPTI is the primary mitigation technique against Meltdown.
Retpoline is an effective mitigation technique for Spectre.
Changes to how compilers generate code can also help mitigate Spectre. For instance, by introducing specific code constructs or instructions known as barriers.

Q: What is the term used to describe a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets Bluetooth-enabled devices by exploiting a vulnerability in the L2CAP Bluetooth protocol to transfer large packets?
A: BlueSmacking

Q: How many 0-day exploits formed part of BlueBorne?
A: eight

Q: What is the term for a type of side-channel attack in which an attacker derives information about a cryptographic system by measuring the amount of time the system takes to process different inputs, making informed guesses about the secret key based on observed variations?
A: Timing Attacks

Q: What performance optimisation technique did Spectre leverage for exploitation?
A: speculative execution

Q: What performance optimisation technique did Meltdown leverage for exploitation?
A: out-of-order execution
